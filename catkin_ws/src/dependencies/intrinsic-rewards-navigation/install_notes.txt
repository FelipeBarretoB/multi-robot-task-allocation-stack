Need to downgrade setuptools:

Errro in installing gym :
 × python setup.py egg_info did not run successfully.
  │ exit code: 1
  ╰─> [1 lines of output]
      error in gym setup command: 'extras_require' must be a dictionary whose values are strings or lists of strings containing valid project/version requirement specifiers.
      [end of output]


Solution: pip install --upgrade pip setuptools==57.5.0
pip install Cython cmake
pip install wheel==0.38.4
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
pip install gym==0.18.0
